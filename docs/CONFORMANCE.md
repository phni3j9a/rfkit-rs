# Conformance

scikit-rf is used as a reference oracle, not as the API specification.

## Definition of "implemented"

A numerical operation is considered implemented only when:

1. its mathematical behavior is documented,
2. deterministic Rust unit tests pass,
3. relevant RF invariants/property tests pass,
4. differential comparison against a pinned scikit-rf version passes for representative cases,
5. tolerances are justified rather than widened to hide failures.

## Case dimensions

The conformance suite should deliberately vary:

- 1, 2, 4, 8+ ports
- scalar, per-port, and frequency-dependent Z0
- real and complex Z0
- passive and active networks
- reciprocal and non-reciprocal networks
- well-conditioned and near-singular cases
- DC and high-frequency boundaries where relevant

## Reporting

Eventually CI should publish a machine-generated coverage report such as:

```text
S<->Z conversion        10,000 / 10,000 pass
Renormalization          8,000 /  8,000 pass
Connect/cascade          5,000 /  5,000 pass
Touchstone round-trip    1,000 /  1,000 pass
```
